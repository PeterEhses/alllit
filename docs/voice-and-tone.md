### Through this guide you will learn how to apply Vue Design Systemâ€™s voice and choose the right tone. Using the right voice and tone is important as it allows us to better connect with our users.

Alllit's design focuses on simplicity. The user should be able to make it work for his setup and focus on everything but the software.
The app should work on all possible setups and in any lighting conditions, this includes a focus on dark themes.

## Crisp and clear

All information, no decoration. Every element should have its place. Every change to the default should have a reason.

## Empathetic

Every feature has a usecase. Every usecase has the features it needs.

## Confident, but not arrogant

??? design lingo here.

## Dense but Organized

as compact as possible, as spacious as needed.

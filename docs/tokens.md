### Design tokens are the atoms of the system as [Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/) describes them. In Vue Design System they are used instead of hard coded values to ensure a better consistency across any platform.

Design tokens correspond to possible states and emphases in components.
The primary colors will be user switchable. Some colors are for specific themes only.
